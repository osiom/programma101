## 🔮 About

REINCANTAMENTO is a research and publishing collective operating across Europe's creative capitals. We explore the intersection of technology, radical imagination, and rituality through digital art and experimental projects.

Our work challenges conventional boundaries between:
- **Technology** as a medium for transformation and enchantment
- **Radical Imagination** as a tool for reimagining creative possibilities  
- **Rituality** as a framework for meaningful practice in digital spaces

## 🎨 What's Here

This repository contains our digital creations:

- **Projects** created during installations and experimental works
- **Experimental publishing** formats and platforms
- **Documentation** of our creative process

## 📖 Publishing Philosophy

As a publishing collective, we experiment with:
- **Multimodal formats** combining text, image, sound, and interaction
- **Open access** to knowledge while respecting creators
- **Technology integration** that enhances human connection
- **Ritual practices** incorporated into digital experiences
