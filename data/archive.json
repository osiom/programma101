    "content": "\"All there is in me is the future.\" - It is a statement that many have attributed to adriano olivetti to emphasize his proverbial impatience, his constant movement, and his habit of always being in the car. What futurability is still to be uncovered in this story? Another digital society was possible, but then it ceased to seem possible. In between: the occult and non-occult intervention of certain power at play in italy, and in europe. Franco berardi: \"Power is the selection and imposition of one possibility among many, and at the same time, it is the exclusion (and invisibilization) of many other possibilities.\"",

    "content": "Three brothers (runs a story from the middle east told among khirgiz, tartars, jews, turks, and so on) meet a man who has lost a camel (or sometimes it is a horse). At once they describe it to him: it's white, and blind in one eye; under the saddle it carries two skins, one full of oil, the other of wine. They must have seen it? No, they haven't seen it. So they're accused of theft and brought to be judged. How could they know so much about the animal unless they had seen it? And if they had seen it but denied it, they must have stolen it. Their impossible knowledge appears to be evidence of guilt. There follows the triumph of the brothers: they immediately show how, from the barest traces they were able to reconstruct the appearance of an animal they'd never set eyes on.",

    "content": "[...] Memory, however, gives voice primarily to those who, as if present, still have something to tell us. I don't know whether it reveals absolute truths; rather, it brings back to center stage those nascent ideas of the future that belonged to a fast-paced, electric time dense with promises—as the full twentieth century was, at least in Olivetti's experience... One is tempted to use those traces from yesterday, perhaps even to contradict them in light of hindsight. To revive, if not those answers—brief hopes that aged too quickly—then at least the questions, which remain utterly contemporary, that those times and those exceptional protagonists knew how to pose. Beyond the opaque horizon of a present that—caught between the despotism of the virtual and the pathologies of individualism—has betrayed, at least in its founding premises, the virtues of the modernist revolution.",

Its well-built, well-conceived machines were sold in 117 countries, where it had acquired a reputation, not only for competitiveness but something more taxing: uniqueness. Their salesrooms in new york and paris in particular reflected an elegance of design that came to be called the tocco olivetti, or olivetti touch.",

In the autumn of 1959 the u.s. government immediately slapped the new olivetti-underwood merger with an antitrust suit, an indication that, somewhere, the development was being viewed with alarm and that it had to be stopped. While the suit was continuing, olivetti began to make good on the payments: three installments, two by the end of 1959 and the third in february 1960, which may have closely coincided with the date of his death. Also, seemingly by coincidence, the new olivetti underwood company was about to make its debut on the milan bourse the first week of march 1960 and adriano was making final arrangements for that the day he died.",
