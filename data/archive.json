    "content": "\"All there is in me is the future.\" - It is a statement that many have attributed to Adriano Olivetti to emphasize his proverbial impatience, his constant movement, and his habit of always being in the car. What futurability is still to be uncovered in this story? Another digital society was possible, but then it ceased to seem possible. In between: the occult and non-occult intervention of certain power at play in Italy, and in Europe. Franco Berardi: \"Power is the selection and imposition of one possibility among many, and at the same time, it is the exclusion (and invisibilization) of many other possibilities.\"",

    "content": "Three brothers (runs a story from the Middle East told among Khirgiz, Tartars, Jews, Turks, and so on) meet a man who has lost a camel (or sometimes it is a horse). At once they describe it to him: it's white, and blind in one eye; under the saddle it carries two skins, one full of oil, the other of wine. They must have seen it? No, they haven't seen it. So they're accused of theft and brought to be judged. How could they know so much about the animal unless they had seen it? And if they had seen it but denied it, they must have stolen it. Their impossible knowledge appears to be evidence of guilt. There follows the triumph of the brothers: they immediately show how, from the barest traces they were able to reconstruct the appearance of an animal they'd never set eyes on.",

[...] Probably—if American power allows it—perhaps deciding 'diplomatically' to grant to another democracy what American democracy granted itself regarding Nixon—these names will sooner or later be spoken. But those who speak them will be men who have shared power with them: like lesser culprits against greater culprits (and it's not certain, as in the American case, that they are any better). This would ultimately be the real coup d'état.",

He or she knows Olivetti well, and has studied the Communita [sic] movement at first hand, is stated in a CIA interoffice memo dated December 5, 1957. This person spoke idiomatic English.",

    "content": "In an even more audacious move Olivetti had pioneered the first all-transistorized mainframe computer in 1959, running neck and neck with the one IBM, with more time and infinite resources, produced that year. Its well-built, well-conceived machines were sold in 117 countries, where it had acquired a reputation, not only for competitiveness but something more taxing: uniqueness. Their salesrooms in New York and Paris in particular reflected an elegance of design that came to be called the Tocco Olivetti, or Olivetti touch.",

    "content": "It was a watershed moment, the first time an Italian company had taken over an American company. In the autumn of 1959 the U.S. government immediately slapped the new Olivetti-Underwood merger with an antitrust suit, an indication that, somewhere, the development was being viewed with alarm and that it had to be stopped. While the suit was continuing, Olivetti began to make good on the payments: three installments, two by the end of 1959 and the third in February 1960, which may have closely coincided with the date of his death. Also, seemingly by coincidence, the new Olivetti Underwood company was about to make its debut on the Milan bourse the first week of March 1960 and Adriano was making final arrangements for that the day he died.",

In the months following the death of Mario Tchu, Roberto had answered his own question. As for Perotto, he envisioned a congenial machine to which one could delegate those tasks that men do badly, or which are mentally draining and conducive to error that would allow the storage of instructions and data, and that everyone would be able to use.",
