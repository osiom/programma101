# Programma 101
*A Conspiratorial Archive Project*

## REINCANTAMENTO

**REINCANTAMENTO** is a research and publishing collective operating across Europe's creative capitals (üêú Berlin | Turin | Venice | Milan üêú), exploring the intersection of **Technology, Radical Imagination, and Rituality**.

We challenge conventional boundaries between:
- **Technology** as a medium for transformation and enchantment
- **Radical Imagination** as a tool for reimagining suppressed narratives
- **Rituality** as a framework for meaningful practice in digital spaces

Our work experiments with multimodal formats combining text, image, sound, and interaction while maintaining open access to knowledge and respecting creators. We explore spaces where technology becomes ritual, imagination becomes reality, and collective creation becomes transformation.

## MFRU31: Esoteric Ecotechnics

Created for **MFRU31** - the 2025 edition of the festival under the theme **"Esoteric Ecotechnics. Irrational Computation and Conspiratorial Networking"**.

This year's edition will thematically focus on the underground and secret connections between media technologies, users, knowledge and information circulation  - making it the perfect context to investigate one of computing history's most suppressed stories.

## The Archive Project

**Programma 101** is a digital archive that collects, preserves, and presents fragments of information, documents, testimonies, and conspiracy theories surrounding the untold story of Italy's stolen computing revolution.

### The Conspiracy

In 1965, the Olivetti Programma 101 was presented at the New York World's Fair as the world's first desktop computer . NASA bought a number of P101s, which were used by engineers working on the 1969 Apollo 11 moon landing . Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs were inspired by the simplicity and design philosophy of the P101 for the design of the Apple I .

Yet this Italian masterpiece has been largely erased from computing history.

The theory: Adriano Olivetti died suddenly of a heart attack at fifty-eight on a train headed for Switzerland in 1960 . Eighteen months later, his brilliant young engineer Mario Tchou was killed in a suspicious car crash . CIA director Allen Dulles, who favored "a double agent ready for action, not an ambitious, left-leaning industrialist"  saw the socialist Olivetti as a threat, especially since Olivetti wasn't reluctant to sell the technology to Russia and China .

The forced sale of Olivetti's electronics division to General Electric, the systematic acquisition of patents by IBM, and the rewriting of computer history to minimize Italian contributions all point to a coordinated effort to eliminate Italian technological sovereignty during the Cold War.

### The Ritual Dimension

Following REINCANTAMENTO's approach to **rituality in digital spaces**, the archive becomes a space for:
- **Digital s√©ances** with the suppressed ghosts of Italian innovation
- **Conspiratorial meditation** on the hidden networks of power
- **Technological divination** revealing patterns in seemingly random data
- **Collective remembering** as an act of resistance

## The Questions We Investigate

- And then what happened? Why don't we all own an Olivetti laptop today? Some say it's the nature of the market, some say that it is a spy story 
- How did American corporate and intelligence interests systematically eliminate Italian computing innovation?
- What role did the CIA play in the mysterious deaths surrounding Olivetti?
- How many other technological revolutions have been suppressed or stolen?

## Contributing to the Archive

This is a **living investigation**. We seek:
- Declassified documents
- Personal testimonies
- Technical analyses
- Conspiracy theories (documented and wild)
- Artistic interpretations
- Ritual practices for digital remembering
