# Programma 101
*A Conspiratorial Archive Project*

## REINCANTAMENTO

**REINCANTAMENTO** is a research and publishing collective operating across Europe's creative capitals (üêú Berlin | Turin | Venice | Milan üêú), exploring the intersection of **Technology, Radical Imagination, and Rituality**.

We challenge conventional boundaries between:
- **Technology** as a medium for transformation and enchantment
- **Radical Imagination** as a tool for reimagining suppressed narratives
- **Rituality** as a framework for meaningful practice in digital spaces

Our work experiments with multimodal formats combining text, image, sound, and interaction while maintaining open access to knowledge and respecting creators. We explore spaces where technology becomes ritual, imagination becomes reality, and collective creation becomes transformation.

## MFRU31: Esoteric Ecotechnics

Created for **MFRU31** - the 2025 edition of the festival under the theme **"Esoteric Ecotechnics. Irrational Computation and Conspiratorial Networking"**.

This year's edition thematically focuses on the underground and secret connections between media technologies, users, knowledge and information circulation - making it the perfect context to investigate one of computing history's most suppressed stories.

## The Archive Project

**Programma 101** is a digital archive that collects, preserves, and presents fragments of information, documents, testimonies, and conspiracy theories surrounding the untold story of Italy's stolen computing revolution.

### The Conspiracy

> "All there is in me is the future." - Adriano Olivetti

In 1965, the Olivetti Programma 101 was presented at the New York World's Fair as the world's first desktop computer. NASA bought several units for the 1969 Apollo 11 moon landing mission. Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs drew inspiration from its design philosophy when creating the Apple I.

Yet this Italian masterpiece has been largely erased from computing history.

The conspiracy runs deeper than previously thought:

- **CIA Infiltration**: A CIA interoffice memo dated December 5, 1957 reveals Olivetti was being monitored by a spy within his inner circle, someone who "knows Olivetti well, and has studied the Communita movement at first hand." Allen Dulles, CIA Director, favored "a double agent ready for action, not an ambitious, left-leaning industrialist."

- **Suspicious Timing**: Adriano Olivetti died suddenly at 58 on a train to Switzerland in February 1960. Curiously, the Olivetti-Underwood company was scheduled to make its Milan bourse debut the very next week, and Adriano was making final arrangements for it the day he died.

- **Market Disruption**: Olivetti had pioneered the first all-transistorized mainframe computer in 1959, directly challenging IBM's market dominance. Their machines were sold in 117 countries with a distinctive "Tocco Olivetti" (Olivetti touch) that combined technological innovation with elegant design.

- **Cold War Politics**: By 1959, Adriano was exploring new markets behind the Iron Curtain, including the USSR and Communist China - a move described by a diplomat as "the most audacious and dangerous ambition of all" during the height of Cold War tensions.

- **Systematic Dismantling**: Following Adriano's death and engineer Mario Tchou's suspicious car accident 18 months later, the U.S. government immediately hit the Olivetti-Underwood merger with an antitrust suit. Eventually, a "rescue group" headed by Fiat acquired the company at bargain prices in what the Financial Times described as turning what was "a social and artistic experiment" into "just a business."

### The Ritual Dimension

Following REINCANTAMENTO's approach to **rituality in digital spaces**, the archive becomes a space for:
- **Digital s√©ances** with the suppressed ghosts of Italian innovation
- **Conspiratorial meditation** on the hidden networks of power
- **Technological divination** revealing patterns in seemingly random data
- **Collective remembering** as an act of resistance

## The Questions We Investigate

In the words of Pier Paolo Pasolini: "Intellectual courage for truth and political practice are two irreconcilable things in Italy." We ask:

- How did American corporate and intelligence interests systematically eliminate Italian computing innovation?
- What role did the CIA play in the mysterious deaths surrounding Olivetti?
- Why was Olivetti's vision of technology as a social good so threatening to established powers?
- What would our technological landscape look like today if the Programma 101 had been allowed to flourish?
- How many other technological revolutions have been suppressed or stolen?

## Contributing to the Archive

This is a **living investigation**. We seek:
- Declassified documents
- Personal testimonies
- Technical analyses
- Conspiracy theories (documented and wild)
- Artistic interpretations
- Ritual practices for digital remembering
