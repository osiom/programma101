            <p>History unfolds as a non-linear process, rich with bifurcations and untaken paths. Yet we always find ourselves bound to a single trajectory. To tell a story, to weave a conspiracy, is to slip back into those forgotten possibilities, to walk the roads that history left behind.</p>
            
            <p><b>PROGRAMMA 101</b> - REINCANTAMENTO's installation for MFRU - moves between narrative and factuality, uncovering the hidden fragments buried at the origin of the digital present. The work explores the unique experience of <em>Olivetti,</em> the most successful 20th century Italian technological company. An almost utopian model of technical and social development, Olivetti's experience was rooted in humanistic principles and social solidarity, with its roots in Catholic heresy and anti-fascist resistance. A project that peaked in the early 1960s until a <em>very</em> abrupt ending.</p>
            
            <p>Infused with the aesthetics and logic of conspiracy, PROGRAMMA 101 invites viewers to navigate hidden connections and obscured truths about Italy's Cold War trajectory, the influence of the US Empire, and its impact on the current Western technological landscape. Rather than presenting a singular truth, the work engages with an evidentiary paradigm, shifting between absences, suggestions, and fleeting impressions. Its truth is not a whole, but a fragmented mosaic to be reassembled.</p>
            
            <p>The work is a multi-layered installation composed of three core elements:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Two videos play on screens facing each other, presenting the story from two differing perspectives, but their interconnection is deliberately indirect. The sound design amplifies the sense of fragmentation and dispersion.</li>
                <li>A terminal, positioned between the screens, receive cryptic messages and prompts coming from PROGRAMMA 101 archive. Visitors receive hints, interpretations, and further provocations to interpret the story.</li>
            </ul>
